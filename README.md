# Advent of Code 2024

This is my repo for my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This is my first year and I am starting out with [TypeScript and Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024).

## Running the code

### Prereqs

The only prerequsite to run the code is [Deno 2](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/).

### Running the solutions

Example script to run the solution for day 1 part a:

```sh
deno 01/a.ts
```

Change the day (01 -> 02) to run another day and change to `b.ts` to run part B.
